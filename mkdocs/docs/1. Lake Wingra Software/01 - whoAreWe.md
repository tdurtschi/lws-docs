## What is Lake Wingra Software?

![PFP](../img/profile.jpeg)

Hello, I'm Teagan Durtschi, the creator of Lake Wingra Software. Lake Wingra Software was created to connect with great people to work on awesome software. 

I believe that investing in high-quality code results in better business outcomes. My approach integrates [Test-Driven Development](../../2.%20Software%20Engineering%20Practices/01-%20tdd/), [refactoring](../../2.%20Software%20Engineering%20Practices/02-%20refactoring/), and DevOps automation to ensure sustainable, bug-free feature delivery.

Since 2022, I've collaborated with teams in various industries including healthcare, manufacturing, retail, and agriculture. I like to hit the ground running and help teams identify high-impact ways to improve their products.
