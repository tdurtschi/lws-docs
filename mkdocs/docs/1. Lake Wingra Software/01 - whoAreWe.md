## What is Lake Wingra Software?

![PFP](../img/profile.jpeg)

Hello, I'm Teagan Durtschi. I created Lake Wingra Software with the goal of connecting with great people to work on interesting projects. 

Since 2022, I've been lucky to collaborate with a diverse set of different teams, including a healthcare startup, a manufacturing facility, a university lab, and a permaculture consultancy. I enjoy hitting the ground running and identifying high-impact areas to help teams improve their software products.
