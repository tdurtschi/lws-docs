Test Driven Development (TDD) is a simple software development practice: First, a failing test is written. Then, the implementation is written. When writing code with TDD, the process involves repeating these two steps over and over again. In theory, this results in all application behavior being covered by tests. Personally I have found that when it comes to software quality, no technique is more powerful than TDD. However, arguments against TDD are out there. I'd like to address just one here, which is the idea that writing the test first is unnecessary. Consider the following XUnit test: public async Task New_ThrowsErrorIfDuplicateItem() { var service = new ItemService(new InMemoryItemRepository()); var createItemDto = () => new CreateItemDto() { Value = \"false\", ItemHref = \"https://example.com/item\", }; Assert.ThrowsAsync<DuplicateItemException>(async () => await service.New([createItemDto(), createItemDto()])); } In this case, I wrote the test after the function which calculates duplicates & throws the error. The test passed. Nice! Then I commented this logic from the service under test. I re-ran the test expecting it to fail. However, when I ran the test, I was surprised to see that it passed! But how? In this case, ThrowsAsync() is asynchronous, so it must be awaited. Currently, the test exits with no failures, because the test finishes before the asynchronous operation throws the exception. Here is the point... if you don't observe the test failing for the expected reason when the implementation is missing, then you don't actually know if your test tests the code you think it does. To put it another way, in order to have confidence in the test suite, you must test the test. When the functionality is not correct, we must observe the test failing for the expected reason.","title":"TDD"},{"location":"1.%20Software%20Engineering%20Practices/tdd/#tdd","text":"","title":"TDD"},{"location":"1.%20Software%20Engineering%20Practices/tdd/#why-do-you-write-the-test-first","text":"Test Driven Development (TDD) is a simple software development practice: First, a failing test is written.
