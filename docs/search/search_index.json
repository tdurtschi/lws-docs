Good code allows engineers to ship new features quicker and more confidently. And I have found no technique with a higher impact on software quality than Test-Driven Development , or TDD . I'm a huge fan, bordering on fanatic, so just know you will get a very biased view of TDD here. Most teams do not practice TDD, and since most software engineers are very bright people, I assume their reasoning is sound! But to me the results are so clear and so valuable, I just can't imagine going without TDD. What is it? TDD, or Test-Driven Development, is a simple 3-step software development practice. First, a developer creates a new automated test that describes some expected behavior of the code. Behaviors are just the various ways your software behaves given different inputs. Here's an example behavior: \"When the user types an invalid character in the field, it should indicate an error by applying a red outline\" . At this point, the developer runs the test. However, the expected behavior doesn't exist, so the test will fail. Next, the developer runs the test and watches it fail. After the test fails, the developer writes some code, then runs the test again to verify it passes. Finally, when every automated test passes, there is an opportunity to refactor the code. After the developer has (optionally) refactored the code, it is time to work on the next incremental feature by writing a new test. As you can see, each of the 3 steps follows one of the others, forming a cycle . When developing an application, applying TDD means to repeat the cycle over and over and over again. A concise way to remember this is \" Red-Green-Refactor \". Why Test? The purpose of TDD is to ensure that test coverage remains as high as possible. But test coverage isn't just a metric for its own sake. Let\u2019s step back and ask: why is test coverage important? What really matters at the end of the day is good software. In other words, the app should work! To make sure it works, we test it out. If the code is complete and it has been manually tested, we can confidently deliver the app and call it a day. If only it was so simple! The reality for nearly all software is that it's never done; it is always being tweaked and improved. Top software companies like Amazon and Google push new updates to their flagship products daily or even multiple times a day. There is a term for this: Continuous Delivery . By completing the cycle, tension is created. We want frequent changes to the code, and we want to deliver quickly, but we also want the app to work. Some teams accept the risk of breaking things, and simply don't test. Other teams pay some slow, error-prone humans to test each version of the app before it gets shipped. The third option is comprehensive automated tests . If the goal is delivering quickly and confidently , the best way to achieve this is with automated test coverage. Invest in Tests One argument against TDD is that writing automated tests takes too long, or it is too hard. I won't argue that it takes time and can be difficult, especially at first. But the other side of the equation deserves exploring. When we invest in tests, what do we get for our efforts? First, as I mentioned earlier, your automated tests replace testing by hand. In many cases manual testing can be eliminated by comprehensive tests. That's probably reason enough to write automated tests. However, beyond that lies another big return on investment in the form of developer confidence . This is somewhat hard to convey if you haven't experienced it, but it's undeniable for many who have worked on well-tested codebases. In short, having tests gives you freedom to make bigger, bolder changes to the code, especially refactoring . A great deep dive on this is Matthew Parker's Why TDD . Test First One of the biggest arguments against TDD is that the whole idea of writing the test first is unnecessary. But to me, when I think about what makes a test good, the idea of writing them first naturally follows. The main thing a good test should do is pass when things work as expected, and fail when they don't work as expected. It sounds obvious but it's worth saying. As the author of a good test, a developer needs to verify both of these scenarios. In other words, they must try the test on 2 different versions of the code and see that the test passes under the expected condition, and fails under incorrect conditions. I really want to emphasize this point: if a test has never failed, it's not a good test . I have encountered many tests that look correct at first glance but never fail due to some bug in the test. So a test should fail. The only remaining question is, at what point in development should the test fail? The test fails first . Congratulations, you're doing TDD! The implementation comes first, then a test which passes. Then at the end , the implementation is temporarily removed to verify the test will fail. This is still effective, but it does add an extra step. For me, the choice is clear. Only writing the test first gives me the confidence I need while avoiding extra work. That's why I TDD!

A Cautionary Tale A new project begins with a clean slate and developers start hammering away on new features. The codebase is small, so it is easy to see the various pieces and how they fit together. Updating the code is a breeze because there isn't much that can go wrong, and if something breaks it will be easy to notice. Stakeholders are happy with the team's velocity. The team is generally small at this stage and everyone has an intuitive sense of what's going on. Time goes by, and the complexity gradually and steadily increases. After a while, there are dozens of components interacting with each other, and hundreds of individual features supporting several critical user workflows. Individual contributors only a partial understanding of the whole system. The cost of breaking something is much higher since the app is so much more useful. At the same time, it's harder for any single person to grasp how everything fits together. Developers begin to lose their self-confidence and become anxious about making changes to the code. Delivery slows down, and bugs find their way into the system. Eventually, the complexity of the app becomes overwhelming. The speed of delivery tapers off, deadlines are missed, outages happen. If this continues, progress could grind to a halt. The codebase starts to resemble a Jenga tower at risk of collapse. Unfortunately, this cautionary tale is based on several real-world experiences. Without taking proactive steps to manage the complexity, software projects often follow a trajectory similar to the one in this story. The question is, what can be done to prevent this situation for new projects, and how can we recover from this situation in existing projects? On Complexity One important point about complexity is that it can be broken down into two categories: necessary and unnecessary complexity. What I mean is that certain complexity is baked in, or necessary . Put another way, this is \"business logic\". For example, an double-entry accounting app must record each entry in two accounts, a social media app must store relationships between users, and a game must keep track of the player's state. Sometimes complexity is unnecessary . A simple example of unnecessary complexity is duplicated code. Another example is a confusing data model. I'd put over-engineered code and duct-tape fixes into this category as well. I like visual aids, so here is a graph showing the typical progression of necessary and unnecessary complexity in a codebase without refactoring: Why Refactor? Wikipedia defines refactoring as \"restructuring existing source code\u2014changing the factoring\u2014without changing its external behavior.\" By distinguishing necessary and unnecessary complexity, it's easy to see that the only way to bring down the total complexity is to tackle unnecessary complexity. If we want to deliver with high speed and confidence over a long time period, we must refactor. When refactoring becomes a regular part of development, it can make a significant impact on the overall complexity: Refactoring Confidently Although the problem and solution are easily stated, the work of refactoring can be extremely challenging! And it's challenging for the same reason that all code changes are challenging: developers become overwhelmed by complexity, and lose confidence that they can change things without breaking them (remember from the definition of 'refactoring' that the behavior of the application cannot change). To refactor successfully, we need to avoid becoming overwhelmed, and this is mainly a preventative effort. Refactoring should begin early on in the project, and be a regular part of development. It's routine maintenance. \"A stitch in time saves nine.\" We also need to make sure the developers have confidence that their changes are correct. This is primarily done through automated testing. Test-Driven Development is the best way to achieve good test coverage. Like refactoring, this is most effective when started early and made a regular part of development. It's Getting Late In an ideal world, all codebases would get the necessary regular maintenance. But in the real world, this doesn't always happen. What can be done about applications that are already facing significant challenges, like the one I described in my cautionary tale? Unfortunately, this is a very challenging situation and teams can spend a lot of time digging themselves out of this hole! The hole may be deeper, but the basic approach is the same. Validating the expected app behavior with automated tests is paramount, as this creates the confidence needed for major code changes. More often than not, collaboration with users & business stakeholders will be necessay to even define the expected program behavior. Next, possible refactors should be identified and the team should consider the cost/benefit of each. A 2x2 prioritization exercise can be useful to identify the highest priority changes. In extreme cases, a rewrite may be the best option. However, this carries major costs and should be considered only as a last resort (in my opinion).

To get started, save the following file in your current directory as docker-compose.yml .

This can be used to creat an initial schema, add test data, etc. I recommend adding numerical prefixes and descriptions for easier readability, i.e. 01_create_table.sql , 02_add_some_data.sql . Initialization scripts are run in alphabetical order, so this will allow you to partition the schema into multiple files, or create forward migrations. Learn more about Docker Compose .
